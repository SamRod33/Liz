    Happy Birthday! Yeah, I am writing this as we watch Jane. Infact, I was
    making this the whole time we talked tonight (06/04/21 - 06/05/21) to be
    exact. Sorry. I thought this would take a while, and it needed to be more
    special than a card with some words on it. So, why not make it a website!
    The fireworks were pretty cool, eh?
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway

    You are very special to me. <b>I love you</b>
    &#10084; I enjoy the nights we slept together, where we hold each other in each other's arms. All the laughs and fun
    we
    had. You give me something I have been missing: someone I can talked to freely regardless of what it is, a best
    friend (besides Matthew of course) that I can spend good time with, and someone to love in a way I have never
    really experienced before. It is very exciting! I am glad I have you in my life. I am glad to have made an impact
    in your life as well. You are incredibly beautiful, inside and out. Not many have that quality, so remember it
    with pride. Your smile is everything to me, the way you are able to comfort me. How are you so perfect? I do not
    know how you do it. I miss you very much. Believe it or not, I was having trouble sleeping when you left, I felt
    like something (really <i>someone</i>) was missing in my life. Even now I
    get a
    sense of emptiness. I miss you a lot lmao. I am grateful you are able to see
    past my faults. I have plenty, and I try to work on them. You have such a kind
    soul. Even though we get into arguments, that is just a normal part of a
    relationship. The important thing is that we are able to overcome them, and
    we learn from each other. We fit together so nicely. <b>Te Amo, Mi Reina</b>
